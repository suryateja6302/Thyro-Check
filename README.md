<h2>About the Project</h2>
The proposed approach aims to predict the Thyroid disease on the base of patientâ€™s current data.
Feature selection from dataset is performed with statistical method to filter important attributes.
To predict thyroid problem we used more than one machine learning classifiers-
<ul>  
 <li>Logistic Regression</li>
 <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
 <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
 <li>XG Boost</li>
 <li>Decision tree</li>
 <li>Random forest</li>
</ul>
