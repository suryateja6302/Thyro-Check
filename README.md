<h2>About the Project</h2>
The proposed approach aims to predict the Thyroid disease on the base of patientâ€™s current data.
Feature selection from dataset is performed with statistical method to filter important attributes.
To predict thyroid problem we used more than one machine learning classifiers-
<ul>  
 <li>Logistic Regression</li>
 <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
 <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
 <li>XG Boost</li>
 <li>Decision tree</li>
 <li>Random forest</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Modules</h2>

 
<h3>Backend Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4></h4>Data Collection and Pre-Processing</h4></li>
Data used in our study is a set of data taken from external hospitals and laboratories .
It includes cleaning, preparing the data, arrange the data that we obtained.

<li><h4>Feature Selection</h4></li>
We used a Statistical Method Chi-Square for analysis.

Higher the Chi-Square value the feature is more dependent on the response and it can be selected for model training.
<li><h4>Machine learning classifiers</h4></li>
To predict thyroid disease, observing the performance of different ML algorithms is the prime objective of this work.
