The proposed approach aims to predict the Thyroid disease on the base of patient’s current data.
Feature selection from dataset is performed with statistical method to filter important attributes.
To predict thyroid problem we used more than one machine learning classifiers-
<ul>  
 <li>Logistic Regression</li>
 <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
 <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
 <li>XG Boost</li>
 <li>Decision tree</li>
 <li>Random forest</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<h3>Backend Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4></h4>Data Collection and Pre-Processing</h4></li>
Data used in our study is a set of data taken from external hospitals and laboratories .
It includes cleaning, preparing the data, arrange the data that we obtained.

<li><h4>Feature Selection</h4></li>
We used a Statistical Method Chi-Square for analysis.

Higher the Chi-Square value the feature is more dependent on the response and it can be selected for model training.
<li><h4>Machine learning classifiers</h4></li>
To predict thyroid disease, observing the performance of different ML algorithms is the prime objective of this work.

<h3>Frontend Development</h3>
Frontend is developed using scripting languages HTML, CSS.
Using Flask trained machine learning model is easily plugged, extended and deployed as a web application.
