The proposed approach aims to predict the Thyroid disease on the base of patient’s current data.
Feature selection from dataset is performed with statistical method to filter important attributes.
To predict thyroid problem we used more than one machine learning classifier –
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbors
XG Boost
Decision tree
Random forest
